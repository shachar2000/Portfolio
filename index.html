        <h3>Telegram Bot:</h3>
        <p> This project showcases a Telegram bot capable of analyzing images sent to it using the YOLOv5 AI model.
            The bot detects objects in the image and returns a list of identified objects to the user.
            The project demonstrates advanced DevOps skills, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS using Terraform.
            Additionally, the connection and deployment process is fully managed with Ansible.
            Ansible enables automating the deployment of the Telegram bot.
            This ensures a streamlined, efficient deployment process, guaranteeing that the Telegram bot operates optimally on every cloud instance.</p>
        <p>Technologies used: AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, GitHub Actions, Linux Command-Line.</p>

        <h3>Streaming (Netflix) Website:</h3>
        <p> In this project, I developed and deployed a Netflix-style microservices application using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and ArgoCD.
            The project involved containerizing microservices, setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments,
            and implementing GitOps practices with ArgoCD for continuous deployment management.
            I used Jenkins to automate the building and pushing of Docker images to DockerHub and Kubernetes for orchestration.
            The objective was to create a fully automated, scalable solution for deploying
            and managing microservices in a cloud-native environment, ensuring high availability and efficient scaling.
        </p>
        <p>Technologies used: GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, YAML, ArgoCD, Kubernetes.</p>

        <h3>Disco:</h3>
        <p> The Disco Project, developed in collaboration with Octopus Computer Solutions,
            provides an efficient solution for managing Docker images in air-gapped environments.
            This project was part of my studies at ORT Tel Aviv College and was successfully submitted
            and evaluated by MAHAT (The Israeli Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs).
            The system features the ability to display image statistics by registry, copy images between registries,
            and migrate images in Kubernetes while maintaining the operational stability of the cluster.
            In this project, I focused on ensuring full automation through advanced CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
            and comprehensive unit testing. Originally designed for internal company use,
            this project is set to become an open-source solution,
            and I am proud to have contributed to its development and to making it available to the broader community.
        </p>
        <p>Technologies used: Kubernetes, Helm, Python, PyTest, GitHub Actions, Docker, YAML.</p>
